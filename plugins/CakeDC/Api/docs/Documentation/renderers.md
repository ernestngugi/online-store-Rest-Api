Renderers
==========

What are the renderers? 

There we have four renderers available for your API. They are:

* **[JSend](Renderers/jsend.md)**: JSend is a specification that lays down some rules for how JSON responses from web servers should be formatted. JSend focuses on application-level (as opposed to protocol- or transport-level) messaging which makes it ideal for use in REST-style applications and APIs. You can see more details [here](https://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend)
* **[Json](Renderers/json.md)**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers. In this [link](http://json.org/) you can see more details.
* **[Xml](Renderers/xml.md)**: It is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) you can check more details
* **[Raw](Renderers/raw.md)**: This is an unformatted response.
